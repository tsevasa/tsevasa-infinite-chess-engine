# HydroChess WASM

A Rust-based chess engine compiled to WebAssembly for infinite chess variants.

## Features

### Engine Capabilities

- **Coordinate-based board**: Supports arbitrary piece positions (not limited to 8x8)
- **Multiple piece types**: Standard chess + fairy pieces (Amazon, Chancellor, Archbishop, Centaur, Hawk, Knightrider, etc.)
- **Iterative deepening search** with time management
- **Alpha-beta pruning** with aspiration windows
- **Null move pruning** and **late move reductions (LMR)**
- **Transposition table** with Zobrist hashing
- **Killer moves** and **history heuristic** for move ordering
- **Quiescence search** for tactical accuracy
- **Static Exchange Evaluation (SEE)** for accurate capture pruning and move ordering
- **Gravity-style history heuristic** with bonuses/maluses and **history leaf pruning** in non-PV nodes
- **Per-ply move buffer reuse** to avoid repeated allocations in the search tree
- **Incremental spatial indices** and **Zobrist hashing** for faster move generation and hashing

### WASM Interface

```rust
// Create engine from game state
let engine = Engine::new(json_state)?;

// Get best move (default time control)
let best_move = engine.get_best_move();

// Get best move with custom time limit
let best_move = engine.get_best_move_with_time(500); // 500ms

// Get all legal moves (for opening generation, UI, etc.)
let moves = engine.get_legal_moves_js();

// Run perft for testing
let nodes = engine.perft(5);
```

### Evaluation

- **Material counting** with piece values
- **Piece-square tables** for positional evaluation
- **King safety** evaluation
- **Pawn structure** analysis
- **Endgame detection** and specialized evaluation
- **Insufficient material** draw detection

## Building

### Browser Target (default)

```bash
wasm-pack build --target web
```

Output in `pkg/` - use with bundlers (esbuild, webpack, etc.)

### Node.js Target

```bash
wasm-pack build --target nodejs --out-dir pkg-node
```

Output in `pkg-node/` - use with Node.js directly

**NOTE: The Node.js target has been seen to be unstable and is not recommended for use. The engine might occasionally hang indefinitely regardless of the thinking time given.**

## Usage in JavaScript

### Engine Protocol

The engine uses a simplified UCI-like protocol:

1. **Initial state**: Send the starting position and move history (no dynamic state)
2. **Move format**: Engine returns moves in coordinate notation with promotion letter
3. **Special moves**: Client reconstructs special flags (en passant, castling) from the move

```javascript
// Game state format for Engine constructor
const gameState = {
    board: {
        pieces: [
            { x: "1", y: "1", piece_type: "r", player: "w" },
            { x: "5", y: "1", piece_type: "k", player: "w" },
            // ... all pieces from STARTING position
        ]
    },
    turn: "w",  // side to move at start of game
    special_rights: ["1,1", "5,1", "8,1"],  // Initial castling/pawn rights only
    en_passant: null,  // Initial en passant only (usually null)
    halfmove_clock: 0,
    fullmove_number: 1,
    move_history: [
        { from: "5,2", to: "5,4", promotion: null },
        { from: "7,7", to: "7,5", promotion: null },
        // ... all moves played so far
    ],
    game_rules: {
        promotion_ranks: {
            white: ["8"],
            black: ["1"]
        },
        promotions_allowed: ["q", "r", "b", "n"]  // Piece letters
    },
    world_bounds: null  // Optional playable region
};

const engine = new Engine(gameState);
const bestMove = engine.get_best_move();
// Returns: { from: "5,4", to: "5,5", promotion: "q" }

// Timed search with evaluation (time in milliseconds). This returns the same
// move shape plus an `eval` field with the final root score in centipawns
// from the side-to-move's perspective.
const bestMoveTimed = engine.get_best_move_with_time(500);
// Returns: { from: "5,4", to: "5,5", promotion: "q", eval: 34 }
```

### Move Conversion

The engine returns moves in a minimal format without special move flags. The client can reconstruct special flags (en passant, castling, etc.) using the game's legal move utilities if needed.

## SPRT Testing

The engine includes a comprehensive SPRT (Sequential Probability Ratio Test) tool, exposed through a
**web-based UI** that compares an old vs new WASM build directly in the browser.

### Start the web SPRT helper (builds web WASM + starts dev server)

```bash
cd sprt
npm run dev
```

This script:

- Treats the root `pkg` directory as the **OLD** engine snapshot
- Builds a new **web** WASM into `pkg-new` via `wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg-new`
- Copies both into `sprt/web/pkg-old` and `sprt/web/pkg-new`
- Starts `npx serve .` in `sprt/web` so the browser UI can import both

Then in your browser, open:

- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/`

From there you can configure and run SPRT entirely in the UI.

Features:
- **Web-based control panel**: Configure bounds preset/mode, alpha/beta, time per move, concurrency, min/max games
- **Parallel game playing in browser**: Uses Web Workers for concurrency
- **Standard SPRT bounds presets**: `stockfish_ltc`, `stockfish_stc`, `top30`, `top200`, `all`
- **Gainer vs non-regression modes**: Hypothesis testing for different scenarios
- **Random coordinate-based openings**: Random legal white first move, shared by a **pair** of games
- **Color-reversed pairs**: For each opening, one game with the new engine as White, one with the old engine as White
- **Even-game termination**: SPRT will only stop after completing full pairs
- **Rich logging and downloads**:
    - Game progress log with W/L/D, Elo, LLR and opening tag
    - Final / aborted summary blocks
    - Downloadable plain-text logs
    - Downloadable ICN-style game list with `[Result "..."]` metadata

See [sprt/README.md](sprt/README.md) for full documentation and screenshots.

### SPSA Parameter Tuning

The project also includes an SPSA (Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation) tuner for automatic parameter optimization.

```bash
cd sprt
npm run spsa
```

This will run a self-tuning loop to optimize search parameters like reductions, pruning margins, and history bonuses. It runs games between the base parameters and perturbed versions, updating the parameters based on the results.

See [sprt/README.md#spsa-logic-tuning](sprt/README.md#spsa-logic-tuning) for full usage instructions.
